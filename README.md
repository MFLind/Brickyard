At BrickYard, we are passionate about LEGO and dedicated to bringing you a wide range of LEGO pieces to enhance your building adventures. Whether you're a seasoned LEGO enthusiast or just starting your brick collection, we have something for everyone.

BrickYard is actually starting up as a new company using my platform that is created in this project.

As part of the project I have defined a model for article number (SKU), Lego already today have their numbers, but they doesn't take in acount the color of bricks.

BrickYard app is managed on my Github as repository BrickYard, the final production solution is deployed on Heroku with using ElephantSQL as database backend.
Domain is registered via Godaddy.com and email service is Microsoft Office 365 for domain. 
For sending marketing mail MailChimp is used for managing mailing list, API is used for subscribing user and unsubscribing.
When sending other mails Heroku add-on Mailgun is used via AnyMail django plugin. 
Payment service is integrated against Stripe.

My next step is to improve the service and go public with webshop as a real business.


The definition is: articleno = [number]-[color]
Example: 451511-002 White Lego Pieces

| color number | Color |
|--- | --- |
| 001 | BlueÂ |
| 002 | Black |
| 003 | White |
| 004 | Red |
| 005 | Yellow | 
| 006 | Brown |
| 007 | Gray |


# Business Model

*Brickyard* operates under the e-commerce business model where we purchase large quantities of old Lego sets from sources like eBay and other online marketplaces. We then refurbish these sets, break them down into individual pieces or figures (figs), and resell them on our platform. Our primary revenue comes from selling these unique and retro Lego bricks and figs to individual consumers, collectors, and enthusiasts. 

Our competitive edge lies in our ability to source, refurbish, and offer rare and unique pieces that might otherwise be difficult to find, providing a marketplace for the niche community of Lego enthusiasts.

We already have bought several lots of Lego over 100 kg (buying in bulk), for example in these lot we have refurbished over 250 minifigs, where just around 10 of these minifigs have repaid the original investment cost.

# Marketing Strategy

1. **Target Audience Identification:** Our primary audience includes Lego enthusiasts, collectors, and individuals looking for specific rare Lego pieces or figs. We will develop detailed buyer personas to help us understand and cater to our customers' needs effectively.

2. **Online Advertising:** We will leverage targeted social media advertisements and Google Ads. These platforms allow us to target ads based on interests (e.g., interest in Legos, collectibles), enhancing our ad's effectiveness.

3. **Content Marketing:** We will establish a blog on our website that shares interesting information about the Lego universe, collecting tips, rare piece features, and other relevant content. This will not only boost our SEO efforts but also position Brickyard as a trusted resource in the Lego community.

4. **Email Marketing:** Customers will be encouraged to sign up for newsletters when they visit our website. We can then use email marketing to keep our customers informed about new product arrivals, special promotions, and other updates.

5. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** We can partner with popular Lego influencers on platforms like Pinterest, YouTube or Instagram. They can feature our products, unbox them, or use them in a build, exposing our shop to their followers.

6. **SEO Strategy:** Optimize our website and product listings with relevant keywords to ensure we appear in search engine results when customers are looking for specific Lego pieces or collectibles.

# Differant view on the website.
From the UX design work I create by hand all the webpages in product (from experience the export functions in Figma isn't perfect, also got information about that from expert UX designer that my employer is using for their products).

The resulting real pages in BrickYard (https://brickyard.herokuapp.com / www.brickyard.se):

## Future improvement
- Handle product stock and warehousing
- Enable bought TLS/SSL certificate of the Heroko service
- My own step in development is to study and learn React (and also React Native), so my goal is to change frontend code to React Frontend.

# Data model
Datamodel is implemented with Django framework.

 # Social media
  I have created Pintrest (@brickyard_lego_store) and Instagram (@brickyard_lego_store) account for BrickYard, these social networks are the primary channel for BrickYards customers.
  
  But I have made a mockup Facebook for Business page as below:

# Testing and Validation

Validation and testing of Brickyard project has been done continuesly during the development, but in a structured way.

Validation been using different tools like Black and pylint.

Part of functionaly testing validation of different browsers and screen setup has been done.


## Validation
First level of verification is done in code validation and formatting by using Black formatter in Visual Code and also in command line. 

Second level of validation is done via using Pylint to validate coding and formatting error according to PEP8.

**Black**
Running Black (https://github.com/psf/black) to validate coding style and format, Black formatter is quite uncompromising and make code clearer and actually run faster.

All the code modules been run via Black formatter before running pylint.

**Pylint**
Pylint is runned in background of Visual and gives warning continuesly, where I have fixed and modified to comply with PEP8.

Most of the reported issues has been fixed, some constributed code has some details that are kept.

## Responsively App
The desktop app "responsively-app" is Open Source tool for check resposive web pages, which function better than AmIResponsive.

BrickYard webpage been validatate via that app.

## Browser and platform testing

Validation of different operating systems and browsers to validate compability has been using devices like:
<img width="579" alt="rmacbook1_about" src="[a relative link](docs/images/macbook1_about.png)">


- Macbook PRO 16" - Mac OS Sonoma
    - Safari Version 17.0 (19616.1.14.11.11)
    - Firefox Version 114.0.1

## Manual test case

*** More to be documented ***

- Registering new user
- Add products to basket and conclude purchase
- Add, edit and delete products

Testing with Stripe test according:
Testing interactively
When testing interactively, use a card number, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.
Use a valid future date, such as 12/34.
Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
Use any value you like for other form fields.

## Automatic testing
Automatic testing has been built in to Brickyard codebase using Django-pytest framework.

To execute the testing according to:
```
python manage.py test product
python manage.py test wishlist
```

The main component for testings for the following modules and tests:
| Module | Description |  Expected result | Result |

| Wishlist | TBD | TDB | |




# Bugs
The development was done iterative and testing and finding bugs occure during the coding process.

## Remaining bugs
- Image resizing via Cloudinary is required for the shop.


## Deployment
Deploying via Heroku and setting up ElefantSQL.
- Create a new App in Heroku
- Link to Brickyard repository in Github
- Add plugin Mailgun for mail service
- Add Buildpackage: heroku/python

Setup up propery parameters for the services:
```
SECRET_KEY=""
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=""
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=""
STRIPE_WH_SECRET=""
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY = ""
MAILCHIMP_REGION = ""
